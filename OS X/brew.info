Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!

Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python3.5m-config
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python2-config
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python2.7-config
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python3.5-config
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python-config
  /Users/gaurav/.pyenv/shims/python3-config

Warning: Ruby version 2.3.7 is unsupported on 10.13. Homebrew
is developed and tested on Ruby 2.3.3, and may not work correctly
on other Rubies. Patches are accepted as long as they don't cause breakage
on supported Rubies.
