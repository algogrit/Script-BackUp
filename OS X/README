Mac OS X
--------

These scripts are used everyday on a Lion. Work well for my purposes, no guarantees though.

Non-System files:
-----------------
 # This README.
 # update_scripts.sh - Use to backup the sytem to this folder.
 # restore_scripts.sh - Copies scripts from this folder to the original, filesystem locations.
