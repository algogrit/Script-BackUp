# Mac OS

These scripts are used everyday on a couple of macOSes to keep them in sync. Works well for my purposes, no guarantees though.

## Non-System files

 * This README.
 * update_scripts.sh - Use to backup the sytem to this folder.
 * restore_scripts.sh - Copies scripts from this folder to the original, filesystem locations.
